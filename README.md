# quja_resources
Essential parts of the klingon keyboard - NOT usable in itself, only as resource!

This is the main files, as extracted from my local copy of the anysoftkeyboard language pack repository. I don't have the time to get the language pack running (my data is from an even older language pack), but maybe it'll be of some use.
